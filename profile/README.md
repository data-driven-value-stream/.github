## Hypothesis
Faster Process Time correlates with a lower amount of Defects in the Cloud Environment when building Software Products.

## Definitions
Process Time - the time from a line change in the code to the deployment of the artefact created by this change to the production environment.
Artefact is a code or a compiled code or a file created from the software engineer's work.
Production Environment is a cloud environment where software is deployed to provide business value to consumers. 
Defect is the reported behaviour of the software product that does not follow the specifications.

## Description of Research
Goal is to produce a reasearch to figure out does Quality and Velocity correlates in Software Engineering. Hence we plan to gather data and figure out is it true or not. This repository is a place where in an open format all scripts, methods and data will be published avaialbe for everyone to challenge and validate.

## Goals
Find more people who can join this research and contribute towards it.
Plan what kind of data is required aside from Process Time and Defects to improve the quality of the research.
Attract qualified peers to do a proper peer review.
Publish the results as a science paper.
