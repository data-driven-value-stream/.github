# Title of Research
Investigating the Correlation between [Process Time](https://github.com/data-driven-value-stream/.github/wiki/Process-Time) and Software Defects in Cloud-Based Software Development

# Abstract
This research investigates the relationship between process time and the number of defects in cloud-based software development. Process time is defined as the duration from a code change to deploying the resulting artefact in the production environment. By examining data from multiple software projects, this study seeks to determine whether faster process times correlate with fewer defects. The goal is to understand the interplay between development velocity and software quality, providing insights that can improve both aspects in software engineering. This research will be open-source, inviting contributions and peer reviews from the global software engineering community.

# Context and Motivation
Rapid and reliable deployment is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring user satisfaction in modern software development, particularly in cloud environments. The concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) emphasizes the need for speed and efficiency in delivering software changes. However, there is a concern that accelerating process times may compromise software quality. This research is motivated by the need to empirically investigate whether faster process times impact the defect rate, thereby addressing a fundamental question in software engineering: Can we achieve both high velocity and high quality?

# Related Work

Several studies have explored the impact of CI/CD practices on software quality. Prior research has indicated that automated testing and continuous deployment can reduce defects by catching issues earlier in the development cycle. However, limited empirical evidence directly correlates process time with defect rates. This research seeks to fill this gap by focusing on process time specifically and its relation to software defects in cloud environments.

# Research Problem
The central problem this research addresses is whether there is a statistically significant correlation between process time and the number of defects in cloud-based software products. Specifically, it aims to determine if reducing process time can lead to a lower defect rate without compromising software quality.

# Research Objectives and Questions
**Objective 1**: To collect and analyze data on process times and defect rates from various software projects in cloud environments.

**Objective 2**: To identify any statistically significant correlation between process time and defect rates.

**Objective 3**: To provide actionable insights for software engineering practices that balance development velocity and software quality.


# Research Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between process time and the number of defects in software products deployed in the cloud?
2. If a correlation exists, what is the nature and strength of this correlation?
3. What other factors influence the relationship between process time and software defects?

# Research Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from multiple cloud-based software projects, including process times, defect rates, and other relevant variables such as team size, project complexity, and tool usage.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze the data, identifying any significant correlations between process time and defect rates.
3. **Case Studies**: Conduct detailed case studies on selected projects to understand the context and nuances of the findings.
4. **Validation**: Validate findings through peer reviews and additional data collection if necessary.

# Expected Research Contributions
1. **Empirical Evidence**: Provide empirical evidence on the relationship between process time and software defects in cloud environments.
2. **Best Practices**: Develop recommendations for software development practices that optimize both process time and software quality.
3. **Community Engagement**: Foster a collaborative research environment by openly sharing data, methods, and findings, encouraging contributions and validation from the global software engineering community.
4. **Published Findings**: Contribute to the body of knowledge in software engineering through the publication of research results in a peer-reviewed scientific paper.


This research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and practical realities in software engineering, ultimately contributing to more efficient and reliable software development practices.

# How can I contribute?
This research is in the beginning phase, and right now, we need to polish our methodology and gather a group of people who can join as domain experts (DevOps, Software Engineers, etc.) and science experts who can help us to be as scientific as possible.
